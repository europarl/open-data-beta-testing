# European Parliament Open Data Portal: Call for beta testers

## Context

Over the 2021, the European Parliament has been pursuing a project to make its public data available as open data. The project will be launched operationally in the 4th quarter of 2022. Data made available cover the organisation of the European Parliament, its activities, and the documents produced during the legislative process.

The main ambition of the project is to make useful data available to re-users and to facilitate the development of new services and analyses by commercial companies, journalists, and non governmental organisations.  

At this stage, the European Parliament wishes to better know the possible reuses of data and documents, and the wishes to address the needs of potential reusers on the content made available or on the means of distribution.

The European Parliament is also seeking for companies, NGOs, and individuals to play the role during the beta phase starting now, before going into production in the 4th quarter of 2022.

## Being a beta tester - Benefits of participating in the project during the beta launch phase

The European Parliament Open Data project team is looking for companies, data journalists and non-governmental organisations to participate in the beta testing phase of the project. The beta testing phase will begin in July 2022 and end in November 2022.

Teams and individuals participating in the beta test phase will receive sample datasets and access to APIs. The teams involved will receive support in the form of: 

- documentation of the datasets and their models;
- an exchange thread on GitHub to answer their questions;
- direct support in video meetings if necessary.

Advantages of being a beta tester:

- Receiving support throughout all the beta-testing phase;
- Access to direct communication with the team responsible for the project;
- Acquiring first-hand experience on the European Parliament data;
- Getting a competitive advantage for your new services and analyses;
- Having a chance to get your proposals and requests taken in account in an early phase of the project.

## Data made available as open data

Seven data collections will be made available as open data for phase 1 of the project:

1. Organisation of the European Parliament, including the description of its political groups, delegations, committees.
2. Members of European Parliament with detailed information about their memberships.
3. Calendar events of the European Parliament. This dataset contains the list of calendar events of the European Parliament: data about meetings of the European Parliament. It also provides links to the related documents: agendas, minutes and verbatim reports of proceedings (debates).
4. Plenary documents: Texts tabled for the Plenary of the European Parliament, containing reports, motions for resolutions, amendments, etc.
5. Adopted texts: Texts adopted by the European Parliament, containing resolutions, legislative resolutions, legislative acts, opinions, declarations, decisions, recommendations, etc.
6. Plenary session documents: Documents related to the activities in Plenary of the European Parliament, containing agendas, minutes (incl. results of votes), verbatim reports of proceedings (debates).
7. Parliamentary questions: Parliamentary questions and answers, containing oral questions, written questions, interpellations, etc.

Data collections to be made available in the next phases of the project (non-exhaustive list):

8. Detail of the results of votes by Members of the European Parliament on legislative texts and their amendments.
9. Detail of the activities of legislative and non-legislative procedures.
10.	Committee documents.
11.	Delegation documents.

### Management of multilingualism

RDF datasets are multilingual  and rely on the multilingual controlled vocabularies published by the EU Publications Office (types of event, types of documents, subjects of the legislative proposal, etc.). 

CSV datasets are monolingual, with a version in each of the 24 official languages of the EU.

Documents are generally provided in English for the first version. Translations are provided as they are made available, generally within ten days. 

### Data modelling and standards

The datasets of the organisation charts and of the Members of the European Parliament are based on the [W3C Organization Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) (an ontology designed to describe organisations).

Datasets on parliamentary activities are based on the [ELI and ELI-DL ontologies](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/eli). These ontologies were designed within the framework of the [ELI project](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli-register/about.html) for the interoperability of legislation and legislative processes within EU Member States.

The documents are described with metadata conformant to [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) and the ELI ontology. Different formats are provided depending on the types of document: Word, PDF, HTML, XML.

Documentation of data models is made available for re-users.

The project takes in account the standards defined for [linked open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data).

## Data and documents distribution

Datasets and documents will be made available in the Open Data Portal of the European Parliament.

Two different access channels will be available: distribution in the form of downloadable files and access through RESTful APIs.

### Distribution as downloadable files

Organisation charts are regularly updated depending on the changes.

MEPs datasets are made available for each parliamentary term and regularly updated depending on the changes.

Activities, adopted texts, plenary documents, parliamentary questions datasets are made available by year and regularly updated depending on the change.

Session documents datasets are made available by parliamentary session and regularly updated depending on the change.

Datasets are made available in four serialization formats; Turtle, RDF/XML, CSV, and JSON-LD.

### Distribution through APIs

APIs allow re-users to access, query and filter real-time data and retrieve results in RDF/turtle, RDF/XML and JSON-LD formats.

### Access to the documents

Documents are accessible through their respective URLs indicated in the datasets.

## Survey for potential data reusers

The objective of this survey is to know more about the different ways you would exploit these datasets, APIs and documents. These include, e.g., may be new services or analyses that you could implement, or new ways to acquire data and documents for existing services and analyses.

Questionnaire: 

- Do you offer services or analyses related to the activity of the European Parliament?
  - If so, can you describe these services and analyses and the audience they are intended for?
  - For these services or analyses, what data and document sources do you use today?
  - For these services or analyses, how would you use the European Parliament open data? 
  - Based on the description of the data and documents that will be made available (see above), are there additional data or documents that could be useful to you?
- If you do not offer services or analyses based on the activity of the European Parliament, do you imagine new services or analyses that you could develop thanks to the data and documents that will be made available? 
  - If so, could you describe these services or analyses and the target audiences?
- Are the dataset subdivisions  and the distribution formats suitable for you? If not please tell us more about your needs.
